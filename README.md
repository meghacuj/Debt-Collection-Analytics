After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered "charged-off." But that doesn't mean the bank walks away from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed.he bank will score the account to assess the expected recovery amount, that is, the expected amount that the bank may be able to receive from the customer in the future. The bank has implemented different recovery strategies at different thresholds ($1000, $2000).  where the greater the expected recovery amount, the more effort the bank puts into contacting the customer. For low recovery amounts (Level 0), the bank just adds the customer's contact information to their automatic dialer and emailing system. For higher recovery strategies, the bank incurs more costs as they leverage human resources in more efforts to obtain payments. Each additional level of recovery strategy requires an additional $50 per customer so that customers in the Recovery Strategy Level 1 cost the company $50 more than those in Level 0. Customers in Level 2 cost $50 more than those in Level 1, etc.does the extra amount that is recovered at the higher strategy level exceed the extra $50 in costs?

Levels and thresholds:
Level 0: Expected recovery amounts >$0 and <=$1000
Level 1: Expected recovery amounts >$1000 and <=$2000
The threshold of $1000 separates Level 0 from Level 1

Steps Involved:
   Graphical Exploratory data analysis
	 Statistical test: age vs. expected recovery amount
	 Statistical test: sex vs. expected recovery amount
	 Exploratory graphical analysis: recovery amount
	 Regression Modelling
